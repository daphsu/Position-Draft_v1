        Documentation of a near-obsessive search conducted by Dee Diamonds, who
        wants to be given a diamond her on her own terms. Her
        attempts—Craigslist post, studying divorce forums, a letter to the Queen
        of England, emails to diamond distributors, poking around open pit mines
        on Google Earth—are documented through layers of pop-up windows,
        revealing the history and mechanics of the diamond industry.
