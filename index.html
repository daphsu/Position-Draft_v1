        During a panel this past July, three members and one collaborator of
        Co-Conspirator Press described the process of making a book together.
        Describing an equality in the way that they came together to work, they
        centered the people and ideas involved. The collaborator characterized
        the design process as “an exploration of consent”: they didn’t
        understand the nuances of design, but were willing to trust the
        designer. The designer motioned toward their previously cultivated
        relationship dynamics which allowed her to follow gut feeling. The
        project manager emphasized process over product. The panel opened up to
        me the possibility of a truly collaborative, intentional, and generous
        design practice. In my previous experiences, I worked under designers
        who valued personnel hierarchy, created divisions between the design
        team and everyone else, and tied our time to money—and I quickly became
        alienated by design work. These corporate structures are worthy of
        critique. At the same time, I want to embody this panel’s alternate
        model of collaboration in my working process and extend the acts of
        decentering, transparency, and generosity into my resulting work.

        This semester, three classmates and I developed our own curriculum<sup

        about critically designing for the conditions of the current web. Our
        interests coalesce around a desire to understand systems—in this case,
        spanning from the technical to the techno-corporate—and reveal how they
        work. My previous projects deal with other multi-layered systems; I
        tried to make sense of their complex realities<sup

        and mapped their networks in designed forms both direct and concrete—and
        also participatory and experiential. I’m questioning my previous
        tendency to be didactic, which can create information overload. Could
        metaphor or abstraction make systems accessible and understandable to
        everyday users? Or would those methods further obfuscate? Further, how
        can we harness the multiplicity of our four perspectives and
        methodologies?

        One night, I visited the Zoomspace. It smelled like bananas, parking
        garage, and sweat. The weather was 88 degrees and smokey, 72 degrees and
        muggy, and sunny with a chance of meatballs. Graphic designer and
        educator Jayme Yen took 18 of us through a collaborative deep mapping
        project of our pop-up Zoom neighborhood, tasking us to reimagine our
        virtual gathering from an app window of video thumbnails into a shared
        space. To build out our neighborhood, we offered aspects of our
        individual spaces and added in imagined sensory characteristics. Through
        this multiplicity of contributions, my conception of a video call
        shifted from viewing it as an expression of our physical separation
        toward imagining it as somewhere I could travel to every time I logged
        on.

        Many of my projects from last year similarly involved asking people to
        consider and reconsider their various contexts and assumptions. I
        explored methods including publishing<sup

        about the potential of relational work in making sense of power
        structures. How are ways that power is shifted or exchanged between
        individuals and between people and institutions? Together, how can we
        imagine other lived possibilities?
